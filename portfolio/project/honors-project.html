A search function that provides word suggestions would allow for an easier experience when searching the site. I observed that participants incorrectly spelled the term &quot;Dyslexia&quot; resulting in no articles displaying, leaving the participant confused. Participants also had trouble clicking links on the website because of the hover-sensitive navigation bar. While moving the mouse cursor, the submenu kept disappearing. <br>
            <br>I discovered that medium to large news card elements was more engaging when compared to small news card elements. Also, users would benefit from an improved page hierarchy and whitespace. In addition, participants commented on how they felt overwhelmed and unsure where to look at content due to the visual complexity of the website. Some participants suggested that implementing larger-sized text, sans serif font, and user customization would benefit them. The ability to customize the background color would also help users who found it difficult to read online due to fuzziness or movement of words. <br>

          <p class="paragraph-large-2">In this project I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on the user experience. It was a real eye opener on what more we can do for people with dyslexia and people with reading difficulties , but the project still needs some iteration as a project is never really finished and always needs some improvement. Overall the project provided an experience that is more flexible, not just for users with accessibility needs, such as dyslexia, but everyone. <br>‍ <br>

          <blockquote>I genuinely like the news feed filter, as it will allow me to pinpoint what I&#x27;m looking for and provides an excellent way to funnel through particular topics on the homepage.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>My favorite thing about this design is having articles read aloud to you. I often struggle to read sophisticated words and focus on long paragraphs. I love this!</blockquote>
